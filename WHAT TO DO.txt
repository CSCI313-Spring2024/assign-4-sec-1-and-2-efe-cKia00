when you click the edit button, you need to call a function that gets 
the specific index of the contact you wish to edit, and assigns the fn, ln, and pn
to a property in the edit-contact component. when the edit button is clicked, use two
way data binding to insert the property in their respective input box. the use of two way data
binding would also help us send the updated data back to the model and when we hit the save
button, a function is called that would filter out the specific contact from the globalcontacts
array and assign the updated fn, ln, pn properties in the edit-contact component 
to the global contacts array.
